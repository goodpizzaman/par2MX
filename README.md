# par2MX
par2 for Apple M series chips for macOS. Based on par2SL.

par2SL downloaded from: https://gp.home.xs4all.nl/Site/MacPAR_deLuxe.html, http://www.xs4all.nl/~gp/MacPAR_deLuxe/par2SL_Source.zip

In SABnzbd if you replace the par2 file in '/Applications/SABnzbd.app/Contents/Resources/osx/par2/arm64' with the par2 file in the bin folder (https://github.com/goodpizzaman/par2MX/tree/main/bin) then SABnzbd par2 will be optimized for Apple M series chips. 

Amazing read speeds! I saw it go to 1GB+ per second.
